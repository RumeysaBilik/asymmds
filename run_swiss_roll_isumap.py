run_swiss_roll_isumap.py -- swiss roll, but the distance matrix comes from
distance_graph_generation() (the isumap method used in asymm_dist_MNIST.py),
NOT from randers_bridge.compute_dist_matrix().

Deliberately pulls isumap_dist[0] (data_D, the raw pre-t-conorm/pre-Dijkstra
neighbourhood distances from comp_graph()) exactly like asymm_dist_MNIST.py
does -- NOT the fully-processed D. This is intentional (per user), not the
"bug" discussed earlier: applying the t-conorm graph-merge symmetrises the
result, which is exactly what should be avoided here. distance_graph_generation.py
itself is untouched.

isumap's own D_asym construction (distance_graph_generation) has no notion
of the swiss roll's ground-truth Randers field (omega) -- it derives
asymmetry purely from the directed k-NN/star-graph/t-conorm structure of X,
not from an injected vector field. That part is unchanged and is the whole
point of comparison: how does isumap's own asymmetric graph behave under
the shared force-directed update.

[OURS 2026-08-18, per explicit user/advisor feedback -- "iki drift
mekanizması çakışıyor"] B's source was changed AGAIN, this time to remove
a genuine methodological conflict, not just for style. Every earlier
version of this file (see git history) located B via a virtual-point
mechanism that peeked at the TRUE omega field directly (X_virtual =
X + omega, embedded once via spectral_layout, B := y_virtual - y_real).
That meant two independent channels carried the same underlying drift
information into the pipeline at once: (1) D_asym itself, whose asymmetry
already encodes omega (baked in by distance_graph_generation), and (2) the
separately-located B, which peeked at omega a SECOND time via the virtual
points. This defeats the actual point of using isumap's own asymmetric
graph: isumap's whole premise is that drift can be inferred purely from an
observed asymmetric dissimilarity matrix, with no privileged access to the
ground-truth field that produced it -- exactly what a real (non-synthetic)
application would require, since in practice you only ever observe D_asym,
never omega itself.

The fix: stop locating B via virtual points entirely -- but ALSO don't swing
all the way to recomputing B every epoch. An earlier, separately-agreed
design principle (from a different discussion, well before the advisor
feedback above) was that B should be computed ONCE and FROZEN, attached to
each node for the whole apply-step training ("ai+bi, bi sabit": a_i moves
every epoch, b_i does not) -- the same reasoning that motivated replacing
the old locate_epochs-epoch trained locate step with a single deterministic
spectral_layout call in the first place. A first attempt at fixing the
omega-double-injection problem (see git history) violated this by calling
compute_drift() live, every epoch, on the current evolving Y -- reintroducing
exactly the kind of SGD-entangled, non-frozen B that principle was meant to
rule out, just from a different (omega-free) source this time. [OURS
2026-08-18, per explicit user request -- "ikisini birleştirelim"] The two
principles are reconciled in locate_B_from_D_asym() (defined below):
B is derived ENTIRELY from D_asym's own asymmetry (compute_drift(N,
knn_mask, k, Y_init, clip_delta), N = (D_asym-D_asym.T)/(D_asym+D_asym.T),
no omega anywhere), but the compute_drift() call happens exactly ONCE, on
Y_init (the same untrained spectral_layout initialisation randers_umap_fit
would build internally) -- not per epoch. The result is frozen and passed
as B_fixed, exactly like the old virtual-point mechanism used to do, just
sourced from D_asym's asymmetry instead of from omega.

This script no longer imports anything from run_swiss_roll_svd_radar.py or
svd_radar.py -- the SVD-of-Delta B variant is REMOVED entirely, and the
virtual-point locate function (locate_B_isumap, formerly defined below) is
now also removed rather than just unused.

t and alpha(t) (ground truth) are still known for swiss roll, so
test.py's direction_accuracy_swiss metric can still be run against this
output to see whether the isumap-derived asymmetry (used now for BOTH
D_asym and B) correlates with the true field -- that comparison is still
the point of this script, but it is now an honest test of whether D_asym's
asymmetry alone is enough to recover the true drift direction, rather than
a test that was quietly cheating by re-injecting omega a second time
through a separately located B.
